## Summary
- Overall, there is not a significant temperature difference between the average temperatures in June and December. This suggests that the location would be ideal given that the temperature doesnâ€™t vary much.
-	The largest temperature difference was between the minimum temperatures, 9-degrees. December fell below 60 which seems like an anomaly. After running a query for December temps below 60, 6 counts were returned. Temperatures less than 60 accounted for <1% in this timeframe, supporting Oahu as an ideal surf shop location.
